      <p>Design concept</p>
<p>With blogs and other websites dedicated to delivering a product, you can easily get bogged down by the design of the website rather than focusing on the actual content you are producing. Though the aesthetic of the website is very important to convey the tone and mood your product would lie to convey, the website is meant to serve the product, not the opposite. Given the current climate and feeling of the website in the modern era, not many people care about how fluid their experience on a site is because the only time fluidity matters it when you need the experience to be as user friendly as possible. This is the case for all the social media outlets that people utilize every day. However, we talking about a blog, perhaps part of the reason the blog has died is because of this social media pull, but also its connection to the product. When making a blog, what is the product? Itâ€™s the writing. My website is going to get out of the way of the design aspects with the focus on the content being presented. My main inspiration is akin to the many artist who sell their merch.
