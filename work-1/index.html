      <p>REFLECTION</p>
<p>Before I begin, I’m well aware that html is barely coding in comparison to a real programming language like java, C++, python, and so forth. However, when I talk about html and css, I will undoubtedly compare the experience that I have had with html to my experience with other programming languages. Anyway, after the disclaimer out of the way. I can begin. I hate programming. I really flipping hate programming more than nearly anything else. It is everything that I hate in the world more than anything. The main reason I hate programming? It is what I hate about most other industries and professions. Programming languages do not lie to you. They are languages that you have to learn. Any functionality that you would like to create must be learned. Learning this stuff requires you to remember or recall what inputs and what text does what, and from there, you can problem solve and use your head to put the pieces together. That part of programming is genuinely enjoyable. I just despise the entry level that you need to understand how to problem solve. I have such a bad taste in my mouth over programming because of my time as a CS major at Pitt. I completed half of the core classes needed for the major, and I just couldn’t stick with it. Coming into this CDM class, I had no idea that I would have to do html. Thinking about it now, it’s really funny that I can’t seem to escape programming of any kind even if I tried to do so. It won’t let me go, I suppose. Nonetheless, I had to execute a design concept, little by little. As I said in my design concept document, I wanted to make something simple and clean rather than attempt to be flashy with my website. The justification for this is twofold: one, I think cleaner websites just look better than websites that try to look complicated unless it fulfills some type of comedic value or artistic statement. Two, I hate programming, so I don’t want to give myself something that I can’t handle. As a result, my first step was a navigation bar that would be the main layout of the site, making it simple and clean. This took me much longer than I wanted it to take because of the somewhat complex nature of the navigation bar. Unfortunately, I had to deal with the float mechanic, and even though I’m sure there is some input that makes this more effective, I kept with it because I didn’t have a better solution to my problem. The next thing that I did was condense the paragraph margins, so they wouldn’t hug the ends of the screen, allowing the text to appear more readable. One thing that I will continually be tweaking is the margins, trying my best to make it look the way that I want it, and also tweaking the design of the headers of the pages as well as rearranging the navigation bar to different spot that will be more appropriate. It looks nice how it is, but not necessarily where it is. Finally, I wanted to make a dropdown button for the writing samples. To do so, I made a big button on the work-1 page that had links to the two writing samples. In the future, I would like to have the assignment 1 button on the navigation bar be the dropdown button for the writing samples. It looks weird having a separate button that isn’t connected to the navigation bar that I have created. As for what is next, I think a big goal for this website moving forward is streamlining the process on all fronts. The navigation bar should be able to get you wherever you need to go on the site, including dropdown buttons for each page. In terms of aesthetic, I decided not to change the font because I would like to spend more time looking through fonts on google fonts and being able to implement those fonts onto the page. Fonts are an important thing for me. a bad font ruins a website. finally, I want to create a logo that I can use for the site. As for what my logo will be? I’m not sure yet. I want to design something simple and sleak like GOLF’s logo. Just a box with lettering on the inside. That way I can embellish on the logo as I go if I want to.
