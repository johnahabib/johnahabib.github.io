    <p>Here’s the thing.</p>
<p>There’s this girl that I thought really liked me. Like for real, really liked me for real. She was nice to me. She made me laugh. She laughed at my jokes. It was as if we had met before, or something. Totally crazy. We talked about our lives together, what it would be like. He said that we would live in Canada. We both liked Canada; but more than that, we could be free from all the world telling us to stop being together. My mom kept telling me, “You have no idea what you’re doing! You just agreed to meet this man at the airport to go live in Canada?” and I said, “Ya, I did.” But then my mom was a complete BITCH and took my phone away from me, “Don’t ever use my phone again, Jeremy!” she said. What a cockblock. I’m alone again.
