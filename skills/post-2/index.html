   <h2>Post 2</h2>
<p>I started my skills assignment by taking comprehensive notes on the different tools that I will be using from the audacity software. Audacity is the aspect of my independent skills assignment that I know the least about, so starting there was the best option for me. I am actually quite proficient with photoshop and Premiere, at least enough to complete the vision of my assignment. Audacity, though it isn’t the best way to mix audio, it’s pretty easy to work with as long as you have a laptop. It’s as easy as pressing record and letting it go until you’ve got all the audio footage that you need for any project. The learning curve for me is the different file types that go into recording audio, and what file is best for my purposes when making the visual essay that I want to make.</p> 
<p>The idea for the visual essay is to write a critical analysis of a film. As to what the film is, I still haven’t decided. However, the idea for this assignment is to get me more motivated to do more visual essay projects like this as a fun side thing. I love film, and I adore film theory especially, so having an outlet to speak about film in the medium of “video” is something that really interests me, and even though we aren’t covering video at all in this class, and the focus for this assignment is to better familiarize myself with recording with audacity and mixing with audition of audacity, I still want to do something that I can find enjoyment out of. </p>
<p>For mixing audio, because of my experience with Premiere, I can piece together concepts and knowledge from that software and apply it with a less of a struggle than I anticipated when it comes to the Adobe Audition. It would make sense that two pieces of software from the same creative cloud would have similar features. The problem that I will have going forward is the tedious work that comes with audio editing and mixing. Because the microphone that I will most likely end up using will not be high quality, the raw audio isn’t going to sound very good. </p>
