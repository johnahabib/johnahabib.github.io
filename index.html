    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
     <p>Jack Habib needs to find happiness in a medium dominated by a bunch of sad souls. People are beaten down and brutalized by the world around them, and Jack is just trying to find the reason for his sadness. He doesn’t want to be someone who is sad for no reason at all. Of course, he can make excuses, writing tirades about how this bitch in his choir took his officer position just because it was “cuter” to have a “couple” be on the officer team instead of someone who was actually invested in the work, and cared about the choir…but whatever, it’s fine. It was in high school, so CLEARLY he’s over it and not writing about it in this ABOUT ME section because he’s still bitter.</p>
