    <h2>WORK IN-PROGRESS REFLECTION</h2>
    <p>Audacity was a fun program to work with. As a musician, you would think I would have a lot more experience with the program when it comes to mixing, but I’ve never touched an audio mixing software of any kind, so it was fun to play around with the software for the soundscape project. As soon as our group started brainstorming ideas, I immediately thought of an easy way to have a thematic idea to run throughout our projects yet make something completely different group member to group member: your inner thoughts. There is near limitless possibilities to what an individual person could be thinking about at any given time, so starting with that template really opened up our creative forces as group members to bounce our individual ideas off one another. </p>
<p>As you heard from my demonstration, mine was about losing a loved one, and how one thought can cloud your mind and paralyze you in that one place and time. this idea was in my head when I was looking in the various free sound effects websites, but I still didn’t have a through line to tie the narrative together until the young girl’s monologue that you hear as the crux of the soundscape. Not only did it align with my idea for love and how it can consume you, but it sparked the idea for a soundscape that focused on repetition as it’s motif that would articulate my theme. Having all of these messages and voices saying the same thing at you all at once can be a crippling feeling and is something that everyone can experience or can at least relate to. The feeling is claustrophobic; it is intense. I knew I wanted to go there because I wanted my project to stand out in what is usually a collection of funny bits. For me, that was the most important part of this project.</p>
<p>When I gave a demonstration for my project, I got some solid feedback about how to improve my soundscape into something more than just a concept. All the beats that I had in mind were hit to the perspective of the audience, the only problem I had was cleaning it up a bit to make it more of a crescendo, a stronger tension to a more blissful release. What I appreciated most about the show and tell was the preparedness from the audience to not only engage with my little piece, but to also critique the piece for what it can be. I hate a class that just nods their heads and says “yes! That’s great!” and calls it a day. I’m not a perfect artist, I need critique now more than I’ll ever need it. The faster I get these critiques from my peers; the more time I’ll have to change and adapt to the times as they come and go. </p>
<p>As a filmmaker and writer going forward with my life, my goal is to adapt my style as I go; that is where the most artists find a variety of success throughout the decades. More than anything, I would like to have a collection of work that can accurately chronicle the experiences and emotions I feel. I, like my fellow human beings, have myriad emotions that I can’t always properly articulate to others; furthermore, like my fellow human beings, need to be understood. Everyone has complex and detailed justifications for their actions. Very few people interact with their surroundings without purpose or a goal in mind. For my art, it needs to serve that function of justification for your actions. That is something that people never really care about justifying bad actions, instead deciding to dismiss the actions as the calling card for a terrible human being. People are just very sad, and those who can’t comprehend that kind of sadness should have some kind of visual, oral, or written contextualization rather than dismissing the sadness in the world.</p>
<p>For my soundscape, I started with the most relatable version of sadness that everyone can experience and will experience if they so choose to: love for someone. This of course stretches beyond the concepts of sexuality and gender normatives, love is an emotion that is not only universal, but has been depicted by numerous artists from all art mediums. So perhaps I’m cheating to start, but I am an aspiring artist, not an artist just yet. I’m getting there. one of these days, I’m going to be able to call myself an artist.
