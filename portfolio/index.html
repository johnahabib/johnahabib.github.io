    <h2>Final portfolio reflection</h2>
    <p>I didn’t realize how much this class would make me love Photoshop. Perhaps this wasn’t the intent of the class you taught, but I just learned so much about style and how the still image can look and subvert the expectations of the audience, it’s just so fun. What’s the most fun about Photoshop is getting past the initial “AHHHH so many buttons” phase and start using the materials to make, manipulate, and adapt a picture into what you want it to be.  As soon as I had the confidence to get into the software and start messing around, it became a constant discovery world that I didn’t want to leave. </p>

<p>For me, I’m not a good artist. I can’t draw or paint well at all. I wanted Photoshop to work for me so bad; it was a way for me to explore an outlet of still visual expression that I was missing. I have these proficiencies and novice level concepts in a variety of other mediums of art I just wanted an in with still imagery. I would say I’m not at all a master in the medium, nor even proficient. What I can say is that I have a path toward proficiency that I was looking for so long. This expression began with the ideas of subversion and horror elements with the commercial redo assignment we completed. I have a Lynchian perspective of suburban lifestyles, so this domestic Veg-All poster was the perfect opportunity to get gross with a picture that once symbolized comfort and suburbia as peaceful. This project got me into the spot healing tool, but not for its intended use, unfortunately. I saw that I could manipulate the tool to make a bleeding effect that could run the letters down the entire ad. It made it so easy to have the letters be red so the bleeding effect could be accentuated by the red motif. What I didn’t decide on is what to keep from the original ad to enhance the domestic feel as something devious. What I ended up with was the hand holding the spoon full of Veg-All as well as the can itself. Those were the two elements that accentuated the feeling of suburbia and domestication best in my eyes, and so I left them from the original with a minor tweak.</p>

<p>There wasn’t much to tweak form my original poster work, more than anything, I just wanted to further accentuate the hand and the can, so I used the sharpen tool to digitize those features, make them pop while still keeping in the frame of horror I was looking for.</p> 

<p>The next Photoshop project I got into was the LOGO assignment that would run perfectly with the design concept for my website. For inspiration, I looked to one of my favorite artists currently, Tyler, the Creator, and his GOLFWANG website where he posts his fashion line, concert dates, and other merch and promotional material for his art. The logo is a stark and sexy look with the simple yellow box with golf in Arial black font. It was so easy to embellish on, I had to do something with it. I decided to take my project in the direction of one of the many embellishments he has created with the golf logo, making it pop with a variety of different colors. At first, for the website, I wanted a simple logo that had a color scheme as simple as black and white, with just a little bit more. I went with red because the color pops super well. The red was the background rectangle that would fill in the space where my name wasn’t. for my name, I just went white as the text color. It cuts through the red really nicely, and I like the combination of red and white for the purposes of the website; the golf website sticks to yellow, white, and black for text, and I wanted to match the simplicity. I went red, white, and black.</p> 
<p>For the revision on my portfolio, I needed some color but adding color arbitrarily would ruin the simplistic aesthetic I was going for. This required a ton of trial and error. I kept fiddling with the concept of the rainbow filling out the outline of my name with a white background, having the outline extend in all directions: up, down, left, and right. I scrapped the idea of the full rainbow. It wasn’t giving off the vibe I was looking for. What I did find interesting is the first couple of colors in sequence of the rainbow: blue to red. It had that old-style 3D tint to it that felt nostalgic, but at the same time has found new life in a quite a few design concepts around the video world, so I went that direction and made my name have three outlines: a light blue, a dark blue, and a red outline shadow that would run behind the white text. The only problem I faced from there is what to do with the red background. It would work with the 3D shadow effect.  Tried every color under the sun, and I really wanted to just have the background be white for people to fill in the name themselves like the techniques the writer designer course book suggested, but I went to look for feedback and my friends didn’t like the inference principle, so I decided to go old school with red, yellow, and blue as the color scheme, with a white font to go on top of it all. For fun I tried some gradients, but that didn’t have the affect I wanted, so I scrapped it and kept the design simple. </p>

<p>The next portfolio piece was the movie poster. The idea came pretty quickly for me and my partner. We used a Fight Club poster, and subverted the text to say High Club with a different color palate to work with than the one given to us in the poster. Instead of a magenta, we switched it out for a yellow that fell in line with the color palate you often associate with weed. The color swap proved more problematic than we first anticipated; it made Tyler look more digital than he did originally. We kept it to start, intending to revise it afterward. For the revision, I decided to take away the digital feel, and used the blur tool to make it look more in the vein of the paintbrush feel in the poster, but then I got excited and gave the background a smokier texture to accent the theme of smoking and weed. I added a bit to the smoke on the main character’s cigarette, and for good measure, I swirled his eyes to give of the surrealist vibe of where his head is at in association with the High Club. On the top, my partner and I wanted to change the names of the actors for an extra joke that was subtle in comparison to the overt jokes in the prominent photo. We etched out letters and replaced them with tongue and cheek subversions of their names like POT instead of PITT, and BONG CARTER instead of BONHAM CARTER. A childish sensibility between the two of us, but we had a ton of fun with the assignment. </p>

<p>For the Soundscape, I really delved into a specific emotional response that everyone can relate at this point in their lives. Most people have felt a semblance of loss, whether that be a family member, and significant other that ended things, or even a beloved pet. Regardless, people in this class have felt and lost love in their life. that was my goal for the soundscape more than anything else. There were a lot of funnier bits that was a through-line for the rest of the class, but I wanted to nail being serious and having the class respond to it as a serious move that landed. In my original work, I obviously looked through the wide variety of sound effect sites for free soundbites, and I came up with the I love you theme that would tie the piece together. The problem with my original work was the arbitrary nature of the soundbites’ placement in the piece. For my revision, like I mentioned in class for my show and tell, I created a crescendo effect that would allow the emotions to build into a tension and release manner. I also made a better rhythm this time around, allowing the beat of each interjection and the beat of the poem overall to interact with one another. The interjections also have more interplay with the story being told in the soundscape which I thought was equally important. The story of this lost love is what gives weight to this simple soundbite. Without the story, there is no emotional core. </p>

<p>For my skills assignment, I didn’t end up doing much to change it. Besides some simplistic audio touches, I kept the piece as is. The story being told in the skills assignment was good as is, but what needed some attention is the lazy audio cuts that were bugging me when I first made it. Unfortunately, when I went back to my podcast and saw that the overarching story required 10 minutes of context in the podcast that I didn’t have time to animate. It would have consumed the entire portfolio, and would be antithetical to our concept of a multifaceted portfolio that included a variety of mediums to convey how we express ourselves. For the visual podcast snipbit, I decided to keep it the way it was and find other ways to enhance it without changing the story as it stood. I also wasn’t passionate about the skills assignment like I’m sure many others were. I operate in a different fashion. When given parameters to control my creativity, I can go pretty much anywhere, but when cutting my leash and letting me fly, I can be unmotivated to do more than what’s necessary to get the job done. </p>

<p>This class has allowed me to explore other avenues of creativity that I had not previously been open to exploring, and that is perhaps the point of a class like this: to enrich students with possibility and potential rather than specialization in a particular field. More than anything, I can use some, if not all the Photoshop works I’ve done to apply to a professional piece, whether that be a production company logo, artwork for thumbnails and future video content, or even my own published website to embellish and expand off of in the future. </p>
